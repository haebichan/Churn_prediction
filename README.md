## Executing Churn Prediction

A ride-sharing company (Company X information witheld for privacy issues) was interested in predicting rider retention.
To help explore this question, I have been given sample dataset of a cohort of users who signed up for an account in January 2014. 



We would like you to use this data set to help understand **what factors are
the best predictors for retention**, and offer suggestions to help Company X. 
Therefore, your task is not only to build a
model that minimizes error, but also a model that allows you to interpret the
factors that contributed to your predictions.

Here is a detailed description of the data:

- `city`: city this user signed up in phone: primary device for this user
- `signup_date`: date of account registration; in the form `YYYYMMDD`
- `last_trip_date`: the last time this user completed a trip; in the form `YYYYMMDD`
- `avg_dist`: the average distance (in miles) per trip taken in the first 30 days after signup
- `avg_rating_by_driver`: the rider’s average rating over all of their trips 
- `avg_rating_of_driver`: the rider’s average rating of their drivers over all of their trips 
- `surge_pct`: the percent of trips taken with surge multiplier > 1 
- `avg_surge`: The average surge multiplier over all of this user’s trips 
- `trips_in_first_30_days`: the number of trips this user took in the first 30 days after signing up 
- `luxury_car_user`: TRUE if the user took a luxury car in their first 30 days; FALSE otherwise 
- `weekday_pct`: the percent of the user’s trips occurring during a weekday


## Work Flow

1. Perform any cleaning, exploratory analysis, and/or visualizations to use the
provided data for this analysis.
   
2. Build a predictive model to help determine the probability that a rider will
be retained.

3. Evaluate the model.  Focus on metrics that are important for your *statistical
model*.
 
4. Identify / interpret features that are the most influential in affecting
your predictions.

5. Discuss the validity of your model. Issues such as
leakage.  For more on leakage, see [this essay on
Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/Leakage), and this paper: [Leakage in Data
Mining: Formulation, Detection, and Avoidance](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~ding/history/470_670_fall_2011/papers/cs670_Tran_PreferredPaper_LeakingInDataMining.pdf).

6. Repeat 2 - 5 until you have a satisfactory model.

7. Consider business decisions that your model may indicate are appropriate.
Evaluate possible decisions with metrics that are appropriate for *decision
rules*.
   
## Deliverables

- Code you used to build the model.  The more repeatable, self explanatory, the
  better.

- A presentation including the following points:
  - How did you compute the target?
  - What model did you use in the end? Why?
  - Alternative models you considered? Why are they not good enough?
  - What performance metric did you use to evaluate the *model*? Why?
  - **Based on insights from the model, what plans do you propose to
    reduce churn?**
  - What are the potential impacts of implementing these plans or decisions?
    What performance metrics did you use to evaluate these *decisions*, why?
